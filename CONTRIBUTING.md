# Contributing to leptonai

First and foremost, thank you for considering contributing to leptonai! We appreciate the time and effort you're putting into helping improve our project. This guide outlines the process and standards we expect from contributors.


## Development

First clone the source code from Github

```
git clone https://leptonai/leptonai.git
```

Use `pip` to install `leptonai` from source

```shell
cd leptonai
pip install -e .
```

`-e` means "editable mode" in pip. With "editable mode" all changes to python code will immediately become effective in the current environment.

## Testing

We highly recommend writing tests for new features or bug fixes and ensure all tests passing before submitting a PR.

To run tests locally, frist install test driver by doing

```shell
pip install -e .[test]
```

To run all existing test cases together, simply run

```
pytest
```
If you only want to run specific test case, append the corresponding test file and test case name in the pytest command, e.g.:

```
pytest leptonai/photon/tests/test_photon.py::TestPhoton::test_batch_handler
```

## Coding Standards
Ensure your code is clean, readable, and well-commented. We use [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) as code linter.

To run lint locally, first install linters by doing

```shell
pip install -e .[lint]
```

Then run
```
black .
ruff .
```
to check code.
