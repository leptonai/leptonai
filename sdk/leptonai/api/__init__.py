This implements the api for the Lepton AI SDK. It provides an easy wrapper around the Lepton AI web API. Note that, the Lepton AI web API is intended to be used by "human interactions", and
not programmatical interactions. This means that there is no SLA guarantee for the api, especially
if you plan to use it in a high frequency manner. If you need to use the Lepton AI web API in a
programmatical way, please let us know and discuss options.
