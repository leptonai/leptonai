Installation
============

``lepton`` is a Python package that can be installed with ``pip``.

Currently we have not released the package to PyPI yet, so you would need to install from source. The simplest way would be directly installing the latest version from Github by doing

``pip install git+https://github.com/leptonai/lepton.git#subdirectory=sdk``

. Or you can first clone the repo

``git clone https://github.com/leptonai/lepton.git``

, and then use

``pip install ./lepton/sdk``

to do a local install.

On successful installation, you can run the following ``lep photon --help``.
